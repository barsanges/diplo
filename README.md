# diplo

This repo is a backup for an old C# code written in 2012. The program offers an interface and a resolution system for home made flavors of the board game [Diplomacy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/483/diplomacy).

`.csproj`, `.sln` or `.suo` files are not tracked in the repo, and there is no Make files / CMake-like files either. Therefore, the solution needs to be built by hand, but this should be pretty straightforward.
